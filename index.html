            a diversity not seen in any other national park in Canada. Sediment left by an ancient inland sea 500-200
            million years ago had since become pressed into layers of rock. These layers were stacked about 6 km (3.7
            mi) deep and are peppered with fossils, remnants of these ancient sea beds. As the continents shifted, the
            North American and Pacific Plates collided, the force of which pushed the layers of rock upwards. Ridges of
            rock bent and broke, leaving behind the ranges seen today. This same action also caused volcanic activity,
            sending molten lava into but not through the sedimentary rock. While there are no volcanoes in the park,
            towers of heated rock called igneous batholiths were sent upwards, pushing the sediment further up. The top
            layer of sedimentary rock was eventually worn away, resulting in granite towers that form the Ragged
            Range.[5]: 5 

            Over the last 2 million years, glaciers have covered most of North America, creating most of the land
            formations seen today. While previous ice ages affected the park area, the most recent, the Wisconsin Ice
            Age (85,000-10,000 years ago), touched only the most western and eastern parts of the park. This has left
            many geological features in the park much more time to develop than most of North America had.[5]: 9 

            The central feature of the park is the South Nahanni River which runs the length of the park, beginning near
            Moose Ponds and ending when it meets the Liard River near Nahanni Butte. The South Nahanni is a rare example
            of an antecedent river. The mountains rose slowly enough, and the river was powerful enough, that the river
            maintained its course over its history, meaning it has the same path today as it did before the mountains
            rose. As the river was meandering, the canyons it carved also meander. Most visitors only visit the portions
            from Virginia Falls (Nailicho) down.[4]

            There are four main canyons that line the South Nahanni River, named by prospectors, numbering them as they
            travelled up the river. The fourth canyon, also called Painted Canyon or Five Mile Canyon due to its length,
            begins with Virginia Falls, and was created as the falls eroded the limestone surrounding the river, working
            its way upstream. Third canyon runs through Funeral Range, around 40 km (25 mi) long. Because its walls are
            composed of strata of shale, sandstones and limestone, this canyon has long slopes instead of steep, flat
            walls like the lower canyons. Big Bend, a point where the river does a 45-degree turn, marks the end of
            Third and the beginning of Second Canyon. At 15 km (9.3 mi) long, it runs through the Headless Range. The
            final canyon is considered the most beautiful. Beginning after Deadmen Valley, First Canyon boasts the
            highest, most vertical walls, cutting through very resistant limestone. It ends near Kraus Hotsprings,
            making it about 30 km (19 mi) long. Following this, the river slows and braids into different channels,
            passing through the park boundary, and coming together again near the village of Nahanni Butte. Soon after
            the town, the South Nahanni River joins the Liard River.[5]: 16 

            Notable mountains in the park include Mount Nirvana (61°52′29″N 127°40′49″W), officially an unnamed peak,
            which at 2,773 m (9,098 ft) is the highest mountain in the Northwest Territories. Slightly further north
            lies Mount Sir James MacBrien (62°07′23″N 127°40′47″W), the territories second highest peak at 2,759 m
            (9,052 ft), and Lotus Flower Tower (2,570 m (8,430 ft), 62°06′51.6″N 127°41′50.4″W) both of which form part
            of the Cirque of the Unclimbables (62°06′06″N 127°40′15″W).

            Virginia Falls

            Virginia Falls and Mason's Rock
            At Virginia Falls or Nailicho in Dene (61°36′26″N 125°44′12″W), the river plunges 90 m (295 ft) in a
            thunderous plume. Including the Sluice Box Rapids above the falls, it is more than twice the height of
            Niagara Falls. In the centre of the falls is a dramatic spire of resistant rock, called Mason's Rock after
            Bill Mason, the famous Canadian canoeist, author, and filmmaker.[8] The falls were initially located
            downstream at the east end of Fourth Canyon, and over the centuries carved through the limestone rock that
            surrounds the river. This continuous erosion shifted the falls upstream and created the Fourth
            Canyon.[5]: 16  Due to the mist, the immediate vicinity of the falls is home to several rare orchid
            species.[9][10] Downstream from the falls, there are many notable rapids on the river including Figure
            Eight, George's Riffle, and Lafferty's Riffle.There are several different landforms in the park that have
