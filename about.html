                <span class="hr5"> Hello! My name is Inês Correia, I am born and raised in Portugal more specifically Porto. 
                    I'm currently studying in my second year of Video Games and Multimedia Applications which is my bachelor’s degree at Lusófona University of Porto. </br>
                    </br>
                    From a young age, I was drawn to the more artistic side of things. Drawing and making some sort of art was always my form of escaping from the world, 
                    expressing myself and to not feel so lonely. I grew up with the thought that I want to be able to make art as a living and make art for everyone so they 
                    can relate, feel safe and know that they are not alone. </br>
                    </br>
                    My passion for art also translates to videogames. Games and art were and are a big part of my life and something that I can’t live without.
                    What I want to do with my art is what I want to do with videogames, reach, entertain and express some sort of feeling and message. </br>
                    </br>
                    I’m not good at expressing myself so talking about me as a person and as personality is something that I can’t put into words. 
                    But I hope my work can express and pass feelings and messages. I’m not crazily skilled but I work hard everyday to overcome and improve 
                    myself not only professionally but also personally. I am extremely curious and I’m always ready to learn and do new things. </span></p>.
